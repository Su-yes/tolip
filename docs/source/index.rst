Welcome to ToLiP's documentation!
=================================
**TO**\ols **L**\ibrary **i**\n **P**\ython is a collection of scripts that Iâ€™ve written to aid my structural analysis work. This documentation was created to help me stay organized and share my work easily. I will be updating this documentation as I update the existing codes or add additional scripts. My goal is to create scripts that help automate common tasks and calculations.

To install ToLiP, type on the command line:

:code:`pip install tolip==0.0.3`

You can find the latest version number `here <https://pypi.org/project/tolip/>`_. The version history and changes are listed under **Version Log**.
